Hi {{name}},

I’m inviting you to the closed beta of **Auto Finance** (Android), which auto-tracks UPI expenses and gives weekly spend insights.

### What I need from you
- Install and use the app for basic payment tracking.
- Report issues in `#auto-finance-beta-support`.
- Share short feedback on onboarding, transactions, review queue, and insights.

### Beta Notes
- This is a beta build (`v0.1.0`, build `1`).
- Some features are still limited (budget setup controls and backend-integrated budget sync are not final).
- You may see occasional errors; please report screenshots and steps.

### Consent
By joining, you confirm you’re okay participating in beta testing and sharing bug reports/feedback.

If you’re in, reply **YES** and I’ll send install steps.
