# UI Guidelines (MVP)

## Product Feel

- User-friendly
- Playful but not noisy
- Sleek and simple
- Readable for all age groups
- Game-like progress energy (Duolingo-inspired) with clear rewards and momentum

## Theme Direction

- Light-first interface
- Soft cards with gentle depth
- Pastel accent palette
- Clear spacing and hierarchy

## Information Architecture

- Layered summary:
  - first view: key spend totals and trend signal
  - second layer: category and period breakdown
  - third layer: transaction-level detail

## Core Screens

- Home summary
- Transactions + recategorization
- Insights
- Budgets
- Settings

## Interaction Rules

- Single-tap category correction
- Clear empty/loading/error states
- Avoid dense dashboards by default
- Use tactile feedback on key success moments (save, complete, streak/progress wins)
- Keep motion short and purposeful (subtle scale/spring on key actions)
- Prefer encouraging, human copy over sterile system wording

## Playful UX Baseline

- Micro-celebrations:
  - Small visual confirmation on completed actions (not full-screen confetti).
- Haptics:
  - Light tap feedback for neutral actions.
  - Success haptic for completed actions.
  - Warning haptic for risky/exceeded states.
- Motion:
  - Fast transitions for screen/tab changes.
  - Slight bounce/spring on action confirmation.
  - Avoid continuous or distracting animations.

## Accessibility Baseline

- High contrast text/background combinations
- Large tap targets
- Clear labels with icon support
- Avoid ambiguous color-only status encoding
