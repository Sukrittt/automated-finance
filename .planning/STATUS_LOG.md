# Status Log

## 2026-02-24

### Session Goal
- Implement Codex execution system and planning operating docs.

### Completed
- Added canonical execution workflow doc.
- Added roadmap, phases, and task board.
- Added decisions, risks, and test matrix.
- Added API contract and data model drafts.
- Added beta playbook and session templates.

### Not Completed
- App repo implementation tasks (not in this planning-only workspace).

### Evidence
- New files under `.planning/` created and linked.

### Blockers
- Need the actual app code workspace path to start implementation sessions.

### Next Session First Step
- Provide app repo path and run planning prompt:
  - `Read current state from .planning/STATUS_LOG.md, .planning/TASK_BOARD.md, .planning/DECISIONS.md, then propose today’s implementation plan.`
