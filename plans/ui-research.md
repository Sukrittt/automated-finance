# UI Research: Mono-Minimal Finance App

## Competitive pattern audit (what works)
- Strong numeric hierarchy on top cards (spend, delta, count)
- One primary action per surface
- Dense transaction list with clear merchant + amount contrast
- Summary-first dashboards with restrained chart usage

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Overdecorated gradients and busy color systems
- Too many card styles in one screen
- Chart-heavy layouts with weak insights
- Excessive motion in finance contexts

## Minimal chart pattern references
- Bar chart for day/week comparisons
- Line chart for trend pulse
- Donut-style legend for category split
- Always include no-data fallback state

## Design do/don't
- Do: use spacing rhythm, neutral palette, rounded containers, concise copy.
- Do: emphasize trust with clear labels and confidence indicators.
- Don't: use neon accents or gamified clutter in core flows.
- Don't: hide key financial values behind tabs/sheets.
